    bioParagraphs: [
      "There\u2019s an old Creole proverb; it\u2019s the old pot that makes the good soup \u2013 in other words, our history defines us. Growing up with Mauritian parents, Clo Chaperon\u2019s musical journey was one that began steeped in the songs of her history: memories of when her extended family would reunite and revisit traditional Mauritian sega music on guitar and the ravanne drum, singing in French and Creole.",
      "Alongside childhood memories of sega\u2019s flair and style, Chaperon also fell in love with the evocative movements of classical music. She remembers hearing Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune for the first time at age 10, a tune that seems to transcend the very palette of the piano. \u201cI loved how expressive it was,\u201d Chaperon explains, \u201cIt was like hearing colours pieced together to create this intangible mood. Even to this day, it reminds me of the power of music to summon colour and feeling.\u201d",
      "It was that freedom of expression that would ultimately lead her to jazz, a genre known for its interplay between form and exploration. She discovered scatting from a borrowed copy of Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s It I Don\u2019t Mean a Thing. She devoured the instrumentalists; Chet Baker, Stan Getz and Miles Davis transcribing their horn lines and emulating them through voice. As a teenager, she fell in love with transcendent jazz-inspired artists like Alicia Keys, Jill Scott, D\u2019Angelo and Prince, the man of a thousand genres.",
      "For Chaperon, the key ingredient has always been genuineness. \u201cI love music that makes me feel something, whether it\u2019s through groove, harmony, lyrics, or melody.\u201d Of course, a little danger helps too; an element that keeps bringing Chaperon back to jazz, where she leans on her classical piano training and music degree, performing regularly with a variety of local outfits.",
      "\u201cI love the freedom that comes with jazz. I love that it\u2019ll never be exactly the same on the band stand night after night. It gives the musicians a platform to express what they are feeling in that moment through the music. Every jazz singer brings their own personality to a song, which means on any given night, you\u2019re reinterpreting and delivering a different version of an old standard, breathing something new into it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s from this brew of influences that Chaperon\u2019s original tunes spring, combining family with history and a rich range of musical influences. <strong><em>One More Day</em></strong> is a lingering ode to her grandmother, a wish for borrowed time with one of her biggest supporters. In <strong><em>Amadoose</em></strong> she sees the world through the eyes of her new nephew, returning to the magic and curiosity of a child.",
      "\u201cI want people to hear a story they can relate to\u201d, Chaperon says of her music, \u201cWhether it\u2019s from the standards that I choose or the originals that I write, I want to take my listener on a journey. Music has a power to connect us all; it\u2019s through songs that we share our history \u2013 hopefully, I\u2019m doing my part by adding my voice to the mix.\u201d",
